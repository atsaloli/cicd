# GitLab CI Tutorial

1. Idea - developing and crystallizing ideas with Mattermost chat.
2. Issue - opening issues (from chat).
3. Plan - using GitLab Issue Boards to plan work.
4. Code - using the Web-based Koding IDE to create code.
5. Commit - commiting code to GitLab repositories.
6. Test - running manual (chat-originated) and automated tests in Docker containers with GitLab CI and Container Registry.
7. Review - making and handling GitLab Merge Requests; multiple conflict resolution within Gitlab UI.
8. Continuous Delivery - deploying an app from GitLab to Docker Cloud: manually (via chat) and automatically.
9. Feedback - Cycle Analytics - analyzing how long it took us to go from idea to deploy to production.
