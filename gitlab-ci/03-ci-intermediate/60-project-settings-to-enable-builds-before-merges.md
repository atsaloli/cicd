# Enable Mandatory Builds before Merges

Under Project Settings, in Merge Request Settings, 
there is a checkbox to enable mandatory testing
before a merge request can be accepted:

"Only allow merge requests to be merged if the pipeline succeeds"

This can help your team keep code quality high.

Exercise - find this setting and see what other 
Merge Request settings are available.
