# GitLab Master Plan: Accelerating work from Idea to Production

[GitLab Master Plan](https://about.gitlab.com/2016/09/13/gitlab-master-plan/)

1. Idea - GitLab ships with [Mattermost chat](https://about.gitlab.com/2015/08/18/gitlab-loves-mattermost/) for developing and crystallizing ideas.

2. Issue - GitLab includes [Issues](https://about.gitlab.com/2016/03/03/start-with-an-issue/) for recording work.

3. Plan - Use [GitLab Issue Board](https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/issueboard/) to plan work.

4. Code - Reduce developer spin-up time by using Web-based IDE [Koding](https://about.gitlab.com/2016/07/26/koding-and-gitlab-integrated/)

5. Commit - commit code to GitLab repositories

6. Test - run manual (UI- and chat-originated) and automated tests
in Docker containers (or in other machines) with [GitLab CI](https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-ci/)
and [GitLab Container Registry](https://about.gitlab.com/2016/05/23/gitlab-container-registry/)

7. Code Review - making and handling GitLab Merge Requests; multiple conflict resolution within Gitlab UI.  See also [Review Apps](https://about.gitlab.com/2016/11/22/introducing-review-apps/)

8. Continuous Delivery - deploying an app from GitLab to Docker Cloud (or elsewhere) via [CI/CD pipeline](https://about.gitlab.com/2016/08/05/continuous-integration-delivery-and-deployment-with-gitlab/)

9. Chatops - [Cog chatbot](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/issues/1412) has been integrated with GitLab 8.13

10. Feedback - [Cycle Analytics](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/20975) - analyzing how long it took us to go from idea to deploy to production.
