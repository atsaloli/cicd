## Unit testing

> The type of testing where a developer (usually the one who wrote the
> code) proves that a code module (the "unit") meets its requirements.

> The primary goal of unit testing is to take the smallest piece of testable
> software in the application, isolate it from the remainder of the code,
> and determine whether it behaves exactly as you expect. ...
> Unit testing has proven its value in that a large percentage of defects
> are identified during its use

## Integration Testing

> A type of testing in which software and/or hardware components are
> combined and tested to confirm that they interact according to their
> requirements. Integration testing can continue progressively until the
> entire system has been integrated.

> Integration testing ... is the phase in software testing in
> which individual software modules are combined and tested as a
> group. ... Integration testing takes as its input modules that have been
> unit tested, groups them in larger aggregates, applies tests defined in
> an integration test plan to those aggregates, and delivers as its output
> the integrated system ready for system testing.
