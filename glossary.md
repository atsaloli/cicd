# Glossary

## Unit testing

> The type of testing where a developer (usually the one who wrote the
> code) proves that a code module (the "unit") meets its requirements.

-- [Free On-Line Dictionary of Computing](https://foldoc.org/unit%20testing)



> The primary goal of unit testing is to take the smallest piece of testable
> software in the application, isolate it from the remainder of the code,
> and determine whether it behaves exactly as you expect. ...
> Unit testing has proven its value in that a large percentage of defects
> are identified during its use

-- [Microsoft Developer Network](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa292197(v=vs.71).aspx)


> In computer programming, unit testing is a software testing method
> by which individual units of source code ...  are tested to determine
> whether they are fit for use.

## Integration Testing

> A type of testing in which software and/or hardware components are
> combined and tested to confirm that they interact according to their
> requirements. Integration testing can continue progressively until the
> entire system has been integrated.

-- [Free On-Line Dictionary of Computing](https://foldoc.org/integration%20testing)

> Integration testing ... is the phase in software testing in
> which individual software modules are combined and tested as a
> group. ... Integration testing takes as its input modules that have been
> unit tested, groups them in larger aggregates, applies tests defined in
> an integration test plan to those aggregates, and delivers as its output
> the integrated system ready for system testing.

## CI

See [Continuous Integration](#continuous-integration)

## Continuous Integration


> Continuous integration (CI) is the practice of merging all developer
> working copies to a shared mainline several times a day.
...
> The main aim of CI is to prevent integration problems

## CD

CD stands for:
- [Continuous Deployment](#continuous-depoyment)
- [Continuous Delivery](#continuous-delivery)

## Continuous Deployment

> Continuous Deployment is closely related to Continuous Integration
> and refers to the release into production of software that passes the
> automated tests.

## Pipeline

> A linear sequence of specialized modules used for pipelining

-- [Oxford Dictionaries](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/pipeline)

> Pipelining: A form of computer organization in which successive steps of an instruction sequence are executed in turn by a sequence of modules able to operate concurrently, so that another instruction can be begun before the previous one is finished.

-- [Oxford Dictionaries](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/pipelining)


> A system through which something is conducted, especially as a means of supply: "Farther down the pipeline are three other approaches to vaccine development" (Boston Globe).
