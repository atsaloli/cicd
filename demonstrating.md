Regarding CE vs. EE, the list of differences can be found in the middle of this page:

  https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/

The features that people find are most compelling are generally as follows:
- LDAP group sync (not glamorous to demonstrate)
- Approval of Merge Requests
- Templates for issues and Merge Requests
- Global code search
- Branch permissions for users
- Prevent committing secrets to the repo

As for what specifically to demo, templates for merge requests and then approvals should be pretty easy to craft into a demo.  Global code search can also be impressive.

Please let me know if you need anything else,
